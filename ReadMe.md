### What kind of keywords we should look for and why?

The compulsory keywords in a balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows depend on the specific financial reporting framework being used.

In general, a balance sheet is a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. Some common keywords that may appear in a balance sheet include:

- Assets: resources owned by a company, such as cash, investments, inventory, and property
- Liabilities: obligations of a company, such as loans, taxes, and accounts payable
- Equity: the residual interest in the assets of a company after liabilities are settled
- Current assets: assets that are expected to be converted to cash within one year or one operating cycle
- Non-current assets: assets that are expected to be held for more than one year
- Current liabilities: liabilities that are expected to be settled within one year or one operating cycle
- Non-current liabilities: liabilities that are expected to be settled after more than one year

An income statement is a financial statement that reports a company's revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period of time. Some common keywords that may appear in an income statement include:

- Revenues: the income generated by a company's operations
- Expenses: the costs incurred by a company in the process of generating revenues
- Gross profit: the difference between revenues and the cost of goods sold
- Operating profit: the profit earned from a company's core business operations, before accounting for taxes and other non-operating items
- Net income: the profit or loss of a company after accounting for all revenues, expenses, and taxes

A statement of cash flows is a financial statement that reports the inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents of a company over a specific period of time. Some common keywords that may appear in a statement of cash flows include:

- Cash inflows: sources of cash for a company, such as revenues, financing activities, and investments
- Cash outflows: uses of cash for a company, such as operating expenses, capital expenditures, and financing activities
- Operating activities: cash flows related to a company's core business operations
- Investing activities: cash flows related to the acquisition or disposal of long-term assets
- Financing activities: cash flows related to a company's financing activities, such as issuing or repaying debt or issuing or buying back equity

It is important to note that the specific keywords that appear in a balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows may vary depending on the financial reporting framework being used. For example, the keywords used in an International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial statement may be different from those used in a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial statement.
